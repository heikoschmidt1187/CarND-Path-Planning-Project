# Writeup for the project
## Rubric points

The following rubric points were met to fullfil the project requirements:

### The code compiles correctly.

The code compiles successful without any errors. With the current compile options, there are Warning for the Spline library that fields are used that have an anonymous namespace. While this may be corrected in the future, it doesn't have an impact on the implementation and can be ignored safely

### The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident.

During my tests the car was able to drive several rounds on the track without any incidents most of the time. Besides that, there have been two rare cases where there were sporadic incidents where 1) the car was "out of lane" according to the simulator - from an optical perspective this wasn't the case as the car was in the middle of the rightmost lane - and 2) that there was a contact with another car that changed into our own lane very short before us. The last point was fixed with more defensive parameters and a better prediction of the position.

As both points did not occur in the following tests and I wasn't able to reproduce them, I need to rely on the fact that the car can drive multiple rounds without incident.

### The car drives according to the speed limit.

The parameters have been chosen carefully to avoid speeding of the car at any cost. To have some space for maneuvers where fast reaction is needed, the target speed is at 45mph - 5mph below the speed limit. This leads to a smooth driving behavior in normal traffic.

If there are slower cars in front and there's no lane change possible in a safe manner, the car slows down and maintains a safe distance to the traffic in front to be able to react in case anything unforseen happens.

### Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded.

The implementation uses Jerk Minimizing Trajectories (JMTs) to avoid exzessive jerk. The maximum acceleration/deceleration is limited due to the time for a lane change (2s) and the maximum speed change in s direction (1m/s^2) in normal driving and 2m/s^2 when fast reaction is needed (fast slowdown).

### Car does not have collisions.

The car is constantly monitoring the traffic around and checks for speed and lane change possibility. More on that in the implementation description below.

### The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.

The implementation makes the car stay on the right side of the road. It has an affinity to the middle lane to have most of the time more possibilities to react (stay, change left, change right). If the car goes to the left or right lane due to a lane change, it will change back to the middle as soon as it's safe and the lane has the best speed possibility.

The car only leaves a lane for a change - the target time for a complete lane change is 2s.

### The car is able to change lanes

As already written, the car is able to change lanes safely if the traffic in front is too slow. Most of the time it only changes lanes if this improves the speed for getting forward. Sometimes the changes are reverted because of the limited view into the future. This may be improved through better cost functions or delays for keep lane after lane changes.

## Original project instructions README

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time.

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates.

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
